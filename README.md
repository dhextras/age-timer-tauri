This desktop application is a Tauri-based project that calculates your age and displays it in real-time. It was originally cloned from [Jack Liang's GitHub repository](https://github.com/jacky-liang/age-timer), and it's available at GitHub page [here](https://jacky-liang.github.io/age-timer/). I've made a few modifications to enhance its functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): You need Node.js to run the application.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): npm is the package manager for JavaScript. You can install it with Node.js.
- [Tauri](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/setup/): Tauri is the framework used for building the desktop app.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhextras/age-timer-tauri.git
```

Next, open the `main.js` file and change the date of birth (DOB) on the first line to reflect your own DOB.

Then, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Certainly, here's an enhanced building section in your README that includes the three options for building the Age Timer Desktop App:

## Building

1. **Using the Pre-built Version:** You can access the pre-built version in the `target` folder without installing any additional dependencies. Simply locate the version for your OS and run it.

2. **Hot Build (Real-time Reflection):** To make real-time changes to the source code and see the updates instantly, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run tauri dev
   ```

   This hot build option is perfect for development and testing as it reflects your edits as you make them.

3. **Build for Your OS:** If you're satisfied with your modifications and want to create an application for your specific operating system, run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run tauri build
   ```

   This will package the application for your OS, and you can then use or publish it as needed.
